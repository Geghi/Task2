\section{Introduction}\pagenumbering{arabic}
The \textbf{Cine-Valutami} application offers a search and information service in the field of cinema. When the application starts, the system requires authentication to use the service.
The logged-in user can perform a search by entering the first characters of a movie title in the search bar, obtaining a list of 10 movies in the database. After that you can select one of the proposed titles or carry out a more in-depth search, adding characters.
Selecting a row, the system allows you to view more information in the right section, including cover, title, director and ratings.
The user can leave a mark from 1 to 5 for the selected movie.
There is also a module for the system administrator: when he logs in, he's redirected to a different activity than the user's one. In this page, he can view some statistics linked to the movies and the searches carried out by the users of the application, such as the ranking of 10 most voted films or the 10 most sought after films.
Moreover, the system admin can add new movies to the application database or delete those already present, by searching by title.

\subsection{Software architecture}
The application is designed over 2 different layers, see figure \ref{fig:architecture_diagram}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Front-end
\item Back-end
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\label{fig:architecture_diagram}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{7mm}

\subsection{Populating the database}
The dataset used in the \textbf{Moviegram} application was created by scraping the Open Movie Database, using their API (\url{http://www.omdbapi.com/}). Given a movie title, this API returns a json document containing all the information in the OMDB about that movie. Before started building up the dataset using the API, it was necessary to obtain a list of movie titles, to be passed to the API; the list of titles was built up using different web pages as sources:
\begin{itemize}
\item a page of Wikipedia was scraped
\item the pages referring to each year from 2007 to 2021 on the site \url{https://www.wildaboutmovies.com/}
\item a list in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data}
\end{itemize}
Once the titles’ list was ready, the only thing left to do was to obtain the key requested by the OMDb API to download the films’ information. Each key provided by the database allows a user to download 1000 film’s information per day. Once the movies’ list and the keys were ready, we could start to use our scraping application.\\

\label{fig:OMDBScraper}
\vspace{4mm}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
Using our “OmdbScraper” application, we managed to obtain the collection of movies’ information in a JSON format.\\ The format of our JSON elements are the following:\\

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\vspace{1mm}
\includegraphics[height = 94mm]{./images/screens/elementJSONExample.jpg} 
\vspace{6mm}
\captionof{figure}{Example of JSON document\\}
\label{fig:elementJSONExample}
\vspace{5mm}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
We integrated our movies dataset with a plot dataset, found on kaggle (wiki\_plot). In order to do so, we searched for matching between the plot’s movie title and the movie title in our collection; once the matching was found, the plot field in the original element was replaced with the data presents in the plot dataset.\\
Moreover we manage some data types, because scraping OpenMovie platform, we obtain every fields in a string format, but to compute the analytics operations, describes on functional requirements section, we need to have some fields in a number format. We run the following javascript code on mongo shell, to perform the conversion:
\vspace{2mm}
\input{./java_code/conversion.tex}
\vspace{5mm}

% ----- ANALYTICS -----
\subsection{Analytics and statistics}
\subsubsection{View the top production houses}
This analytic is performed to display all production houses.
\subsubsection{Top rated movies by year and country}

\subsection{MongoDb index}
In order to speeding up some operations, we introduce some indexes ...

% ----- IMPLEMENTATION -----
\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Used technologies}
The application is developed in java programming language, version 11.0.4, and in JavaFX system to create the GUI, version 11, so it should run on each platform in which JVM is installed, but the application is tested and guardantee on Ubuntu 16 and Window OS. Moreover Maven is used  to build and mantain the project, version 3.8.0. \\
The java driver for mongo manage the comunication between client application layer and mongo backend layer, version 3.11.2.\\ 
For the backend layer it is used MongoDB, version 4.2.\\
So this application is tested using these technologies, considering these particular versions: for other versions the correct execution isn't guaranteed .\\

\subsection{Replica setup}
The following code shows how it is realized the architecture in which 3 mongo server are running in back end layer:
\vspace{2mm}
\input{./java_code/replicaSetup.tex}

 Another foundamental class is MongoManager, that manages the db-connection and the related operations.
 The implementation of a set of CRUD operations is desribed as follows.


\subsection{Create}
Adding one or more films to the database using a json document as input.
\vspace{2mm}
 \\<Code here>

\subsection{Read}
This functionality returns a list of films searched by title. A film is returned if its title contains a piece of the searched title (case insensitive).\\
\vspace{2mm}
\\<code here>
\vspace{5mm}

\subsection{Update}
This operation allows users to update their vote about a selected film.\\
\vspace{2mm}
\\<code here>
\vspace{5mm}

\subsection{Delete}

\\<code here>
\vspace{5mm}

\clearpage

\subsection{Analytics}
In this phase the analytics operations that a user is able to perform on the database are shown.

\subsection{GUI}
There are three fxml documents, one for each page of the application, which describes the objects showed in the GUI interface of the related page.
\begin{itemize}
\item Home.fxml
\item Login.fxml
\item Register.fxml
\end{itemize}
In addiction there are 3 classes, called Controllers, that are in charge of handling events of the objects defined in the associated fxml document.
\begin{itemize}
\item HomeController.java
\item LoginController.java
\item RegisterController.java
\end{itemize}
